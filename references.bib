  abstract = {This paper studies the effect of the order of depth of mention on nested named entity recognition (NER) models. NER is an essential task in the extraction of biomedical information, and nested entities are common since medical concepts can assemble to form larger entities. Conventional NER systems only predict disjointed entities. Thus, iterative models for nested NER use multiple predictions to enumerate all entities, imposing a predefined order from largest to smallest or smallest to largest. We design an order-agnostic iterative model and a procedure to choose a custom order during training and prediction. We propose a modification of the Transformer architecture to take into account the entities predicted in the previous steps. We provide a set of experiments to study the model's capabilities and the effects of the order on performance. Finally, we show that the smallest to largest order gives the best results.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Concept normalization is the task of linking terms from textual medical documents to their concept in terminologies such as the UMLS{\textregistered}. Traditional approaches to this problem depend heavily on the coverage of available resources, which poses a problem for languages other than English. Objective: We present a system for concept normalization in French. We consider textual mentions already extracted and labeled by a named entity recognition system, and we classify these mentions with a UMLS concept unique identifier. We take advantage of the multilingual nature of available terminologies and embedding models to improve concept normalization in French without translation nor direct supervision. Materials and methods: We consider the task as a highly-multiclass classification problem. The terms are encoded with contextualized embeddings and classified via cosine similarity and softmax. A first step uses a subset of the terminology to finetune the embeddings and train the model. A second step adds the entire target terminology, and the model is trained further with hard negative selection and softmax sampling. Results: On two corpora from the Quaero FrenchMed benchmark, we show that our approach can lead to good results even with no labeled data at all; and that it outperforms existing supervised methods with labeled data. Discussion: Training the system with both French and English terms improves by a large margin the performance of the system on a French benchmark, regardless of the way the embeddings were pretrained (French, English, multilingual). Our distantly supervised method can be applied to any kind of documents or medical domain, as it does not require any concept-labeled documents. Conclusion: These experiments pave the way for simpler and more effective multilingual approaches to processing medical texts in languages other than English.},

  abstract = {Background               Valuable insights gathered by clinicians during their inquiries and documented in textual reports are often unavailable in the structured data recorded in electronic health records (EHRs).                                         Objective               This study aimed to highlight that mining unstructured textual data with natural language processing techniques complements the available structured data and enables more comprehensive patient phenotyping. A proof-of-concept for patients diagnosed with specific autoimmune diseases is presented, in which the extraction of information on laboratory tests and drug treatments is performed.                                         Methods               We collected EHRs available in the clinical data warehouse of the Greater Paris University Hospitals from 2012 to 2021 for patients hospitalized and diagnosed with 1 of 4 immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and Takayasu arteritis. Then, we built, trained, and validated natural language processing algorithms on 103 discharge summaries selected from the cohort and annotated by a clinician. Finally, all discharge summaries in the cohort were processed with the algorithms, and the extracted data on laboratory tests and drug treatments were compared with the structured data.                                         Results               Named entity recognition followed by normalization yielded F1-scores of 71.1 (95\% CI 63.6-77.8) for the laboratory tests and 89.3 (95\% CI 85.9-91.6) for the drugs. Application of the algorithms to 18,604 EHRs increased the detection of antibody results and drug treatments. For instance, among patients in the systemic lupus erythematosus cohort with positive antinuclear antibodies, the rate increased from 18.34\% (752/4102) to 71.87\% (2949/4102), making the results more consistent with the literature.                                         Conclusions               While challenges remain in standardizing laboratory tests, particularly with abbreviations, this work, based on secondary use of clinical data, demonstrates that automated processing of discharge summaries enriched the information available in structured data and facilitated more comprehensive patient profiling.},
